🐸 Kero City

Kero City is a 2D narrative adventure game that follows a young frog leaving his quiet swamp hometown to study and find himself in a multicultural metropolis inspired by New York, Philadelphia, and Tokyo.
Blending storytelling, emotion, and pixel art, the game explores what it means to start over — navigating loneliness, cultural differences, and self-discovery in a city that never sleeps.


🎮 Features

- Narrative-driven gameplay with emotional branching dialogue
- AI-driven emotion system that adapts dialogue, visuals, and background music based on player choices
- Original pixel art assets and UI created in Aseprite and Adobe Photoshop
- Dynamic soundtrack system that reacts to player emotion states
- Themes of identity, belonging, and adaptation in a globalized world


🧠 Development

Kero City is a solo-developed passion project combining art, storytelling, and programming.
It is being developed in Java, with gameplay systems designed to be modular and scalable for future story chapters.


Tools & Technologies:

- Java (core logic & game engine)
- Aseprite / Adobe Photoshop (art & animation)
- Adobe After Effects / Premiere (cutscenes & editing)


🚧 Current Status

✅ Concept and narrative design complete
✅ Emotion system prototype built
🧩 Gameplay systems in progress
🎨 Background and character art in development

🌱 Inspiration

Kero City draws from personal experiences as an international student adapting to a new city, inspired by retro JRPG aesthetics and atmospheric storytelling from games like Night in the Woods and Omori.


💡 Future Plans
- Implement full dialogue system with emotional responses
- Expand city exploration and NPC interactions
- Add branching endings based on emotion history
